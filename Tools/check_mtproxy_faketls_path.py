"""Static guard for the active MTProxy FakeTLS transport path.

The working reference is tsrman/tg commit 9fe18931 for the risky fingerprint
parts: direct Firefox ClientHello, whole ClientHello send, and the original
fixed TLS record cap for wrapped data. The Android transport adds nonblocking
startup pacing, startup diagnostics, and a TLS write queue so MTProto payload
bytes are not discarded until the full TLS record has been sent.
